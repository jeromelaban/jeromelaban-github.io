<p>I've decided, after a long time, to publish the source code of my little utility on CodePlex : <a href="http://vmmove.codeplex.com">http://vmmove.codeplex.com</a></p>
<p>It that allows to perform attach and detach operations of Hyper-V VMs.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://jaylee.org/post/2009/03/28/Hyper-V-Virtual-Machine-Mover-and-Hyper-V-Server.aspx">discussed a while back</a> the origin of Hyper-V VM Mover, and as of now, Microsoft still has no official method for attaching and detaching VMs without export and import operations.</p>
<p>Feel free to submit updates and comments on the tool !</p>
