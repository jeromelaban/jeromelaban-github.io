<font face="Tahoma" size="2">If you follow the news surrounding Windows Vista, this must not be a surprise for you but, Vista&#39;s commercial offer can be quite confusing. Confusing enough for jokes to surface like these two </font><a href="http://www.bbspot.com/Images/News_Features/2007/02/vista_upgrade_flowchart.pdf"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">here</font></a><font face="Tahoma" size="2"> and </font><a href="http://www.joyoftech.com/joyoftech/joyarchives/915.html"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">there</font></a><font face="Tahoma" size="2">. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Tahoma" size="2">Of course, Paul&#39;s trying to explain it simple enough by </font><a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_which.asp"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">breaking down version features</font></a><font face="Tahoma" size="2">, but I&#39;m not sure that end real end user&#39;s going to get it. Plus, if you add the OEM/Retail differenciation, that confuses it a bit more. And I too don&#39;t know which version I&#39;m going to get...</font>
</p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Tahoma" size="2">Anyway, with &quot;upgraders&quot; the biggest problem for Vista is that there is no &quot;gotta get&quot; feature, but reather a myriad of features that are worth looking into but that are not visible at first sight. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Tahoma" size="2">One that is definitely not visible at first sight is <strong>SuperFetch</strong>, which actually has no UI. This one&#39;s tweaking your computer by trying to guess what you&#39;ll be doing next and prefetch files that you&#39;ll probably need. All that based on your computer usage. Obviously, if it is based on comptuer usage, and you just look at it for 2 hours, you&#39;re not going to get the best out of it. And this one&#39;s pretty effective.</font>
</p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Tahoma" size="2">So, my advice for people in that position, just give it a try and don&#39;t tell yourself&nbsp; <em>&quot;Oh yeah, right... that&#39;s Windows&nbsp;XP with a fancy UI, that&#39;s all...&quot;</em>, that&#39;s not the way to go.</font>
</p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Tahoma" size="2">Just my two cents...</font>
