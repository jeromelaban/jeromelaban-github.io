<font face="Tahoma" size="2">As a new user of VS2008 and senior user of VS2005, you may just just start to convert your projects to VS2008. Good. Then you look at your solution and start to look for your favorite project in the Solution Explorer and have trouble finding it... Of course ! The list is not sorted...</font> 
</p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Tahoma" size="2">You may wonder, where is that sorting gone ? Well, I don&#39;t know exactly but it seems that if you <strong>select a project,&nbsp;press F2, then enter without modifying a thing... The tree sorts itself out!</strong> The bad thing is that you&nbsp;can&#39;t save that sorted list, as it seems that&nbsp;it is only the TreeView that sorts the item list, not the internal list that is sorted... I know for a fact that there are some PowerToys that sort the entries in the SLN file, I&#39;ll try to look for that.</font>
