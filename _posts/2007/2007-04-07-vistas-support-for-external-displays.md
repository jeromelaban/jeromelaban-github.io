<p align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Among the many hidden new features of vista which belong to the category of &quot;<em>why didn&#39;t they do this in the first place</em>&quot;, there is the new and improved support for displays and external displays in particular for a laptop.</font>
</p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">In Windows XP, when you were attaching a display to your laptop, the resolution (and color depth) used was attached to the physical port, not to the display itself. So if you were moving around a lot with your laptop attaching many displays with many different resolutions, you had to reconfigure each time.</font>
</p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Vista&#39;s way is a bit different since the resolution and color depth are now attached to each specific display, and are automatically recalled upon connecting the cable. Now, when you attach a display, you can hear the &quot;device connected&quot; sound, the same used when connecting an USB device or PCMCIA card.</font>
</p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">This also goes along with the presentation mode which allows to hide your trolling background when hosting a presentation. This is particularly useful at Epitech :)<br />
