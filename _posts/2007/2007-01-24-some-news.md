<P align=justify><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Here it is ! I've promised for too long now that I'd be adding a blog to this web site, and here it is ! I had some time last weekend, and&nbsp;I decided to update the site to add it.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Verdana size=2>It's pretty simple stuff in ASP.NET 2.0 and SQL Server 2005, but it allows posts to have comments, to be grouped and shown in the rss by groups. Nothing new, really.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Verdana size=2>The point on creating this blog here is to be able to write in english and not bother french readers (my native language)&nbsp;on community blogs. Plus, I'll try to add some more frequent updates on </FONT><A href="http://www.jaylee.org/remotecontrol"><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Bluetooth Remote Control</FONT></A><FONT face=Verdana size=2> for which, wandering around the web, I've found some users having trouble with it that I did not know about.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Verdana size=2>I've also been busy lately getting on to certifications such as MCTS (via the MCSD Upgrade part 1), and MCT. Upgrade part 2 is coming soon too...</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Anyway, if you want to get in touch with me directly and publicly, feel free to do so here.</FONT></P>
