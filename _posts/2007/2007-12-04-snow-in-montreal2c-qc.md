The last time there was that much snow in here at this time of the year was many years ago, and this time&nbsp;40 centimeters fell from the sky in 24 hours. For what I can see here and there, some are happy about that, some a bit less. Schools are closed, traffic quite a bit jammed and offices part&nbsp;empty.</font>
