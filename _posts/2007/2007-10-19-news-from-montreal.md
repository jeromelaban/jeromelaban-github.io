<font face="Verdana" size="2">There I am ! I&#39;m now in Montr&eacute;al, enjoying my <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/10/18/french.strikes/index.html?iref=newssearch">strike-free environment</a>&nbsp;! Weather&#39;s still good with a pleasant temperature,&nbsp;at the end of the &quot;&eacute;t&eacute; des indiens&quot;.</font>

<font face="Verdana" size="2">After&nbsp;visiting a bunch of canadian administrations,&nbsp;I&#39;m now enjoying some peaceful time with my wife, visiting some places and friends we&#39;ve&nbsp;seen the last time we went there. People here are so much cooler than in Paris... No one&nbsp;rushing even at peak hours in the subway, people waiting in line to take&nbsp;the bus... I like that ! I&#39;m told that compared to Qu&eacute;bec city, Montreal life is stressing. I wonder how&#39;s life in Qu&eacute;bec ! Point of&nbsp;view and stuff...&nbsp;</font>

<font face="Verdana" size="2">Relocating is not an easy thing to do, with so many things to think at once, like selling stuff, terminating contracts and stuff. Well, this is done now :) If you ever need to ship some personal effects from france, I can tell you&nbsp;that &quot;Bagages du Monde&quot; is doing great. </font>
