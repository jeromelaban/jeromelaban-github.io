<!-- more -->
<P align=justify><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>There's one feature that's been a long lasting request, and did not have the time to technically look into : The ability to execute any command when the phone is ringing.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>I had a few time lately to work on this and now, Bluetooth Remote Control now has the ability to run a command when a phone event is raised. I'm currently adding "Phone Ringing" and "Call in Progress". But I'll probably be adding some more, like incoming SMS and stuff like that.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>This is going to be interesting for people wanting their music to pause during their conversation, and unpause when they hang up.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>This release should be available shortly.</FONT></P>
