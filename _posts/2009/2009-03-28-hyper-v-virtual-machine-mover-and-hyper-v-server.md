<p>
I&#39;ve had some hardware trouble lately, with hard-drives failing with some VMs on these, and my Hyper-V Mover tool hase saved me a great deal of time. 
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had some time to improve it and this time, it is possible to attach and detach VMs from remote machines, and particularly those that are on Hyper-V Server machines.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve created a page for this tool, the <a href="/page/Hyper-V-Virtual-Machine-Mover.aspx">Hyper-V Virtual Machine Mover</a>, version 1.0.1.0.
</p>
<p>
Still no sources available but they&#39;ll be available on CodePlex soon.
