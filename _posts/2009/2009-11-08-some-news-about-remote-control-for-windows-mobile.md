<p>The long standing last <a title="Remote Control for Windows Mobile" href="http://jaylee.org/post/2008/04/01/Bluetooth-Remote-Control-0902c-Round-2.aspx" target="_blank">release 0.9.0</a> has been out for a while now, more than a year and a half. It&rsquo;s been downloaded a lot, over 150.000 times.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about the actual usage, but judging by the steady flow of comments and suggestions I&rsquo;m receiving, I&rsquo;m guessing quite a few people are using it.</p>
<p>Since the middle of october, Microsoft has pushed out its <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/catalog/cataloghome.aspx" target="_blank">Marketplace for Windows Mobile</a>, I have decided that I will be giving a try to this method of publication. The software will not be free this time, but it will be at a price that will not break the bank. I&rsquo;ll leave the current free application available, but I will not update it anymore. I&rsquo;m sure that this new paid version will disapoint some of the current users, but that&rsquo;s a &ldquo;price&rdquo; to pay and I&rsquo;m willing to take that risk.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping that the marketplace will broaden the audience, and the app will be available at first in french, english, spanish and portuguese.</p>
<p>About the new features and enhancement of this new version :</p>
<ul>
<li>Wifi support for all the users that do not have a bluetooth hardware</li>
<li>Improved performance</li>
<li>Support for High DPI and VGA devices</li>
<li>Windows 7 support, obviously</li>
<li>64 Bits compatibility</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m also planning on improving the &ldquo;touch&rdquo; support, since the app was originally designed for devices that had many hardware keys, back in 2003. Most recent devices hardly have any hardware keys, and for good reasons.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks to all the regular users of <a title="Remote Control for Windows Mobile" href="http://jaylee.org/remotecontrol/" target="_blank">Remote Control for Windows Mobile</a> !</p>
