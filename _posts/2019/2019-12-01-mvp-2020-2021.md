What a year! 

I've been doing full Open Source work for the past year and a half, giving talks about .NET, Xamarin, Mono and WebAssembly, contributing to open source projects, and Microsoft noticed!

I've been awarded [MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/) by Microsoft for 2020-2021 for the Developer Technologies, 8 years after being a "Visual C#" MVP from 2009 to 2011.

I'd like to personally thank the amazing MVPs that supported me through this process, [SÃ©bastien Lachance](https://twitter.com/archiecoder), [Jim Wilcox](https://twitter.com/GraniteStHacker), [Geoffrey Huntley](https://twitter.com/GeoffreyHuntley), as well as Microsoft employees (Thanks Clint, Karel, Rochelle, Jesus, Ryan, Betsy).

I'm glad to be back as an MVP, and off to a new year with this great community!
