<p>
<font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2">Two&nbsp;small errors have slipped into the configuration file of version 0.9.0, preventing it from controlling Windows Media Center. Since it is a rather small update, as this is only the application definition file that is modified, I did not increase the version number.</font>
