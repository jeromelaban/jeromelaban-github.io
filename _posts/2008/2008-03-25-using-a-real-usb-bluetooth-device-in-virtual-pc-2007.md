<font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2">This is one of the biggest missing features of VPC 2007, the lack of USB&nbsp;passthrough&nbsp;support. The lack of a proper snapshot feature is annoying too, even though it is possible to move Undo Disks to simulate snapshots. But I still prefer VPC 2007 over VMWare, mainly because I find the latter to be too intrusive and unstable...</font>

<font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2">Anyway, I was looking for any update to VPC 2007 for the support of USB devices, in one form or an</font><font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2">other, maybe with a beta VPC 2008 or 2009. This is still not happening but, I came across this software, </font><a href="http://www.usb-over-network.com" target="_blank" title="Usb Over Network"><font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2">Usb over Network</font></a><font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2">, which does exactly what I need to do. </font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2">This software is particularly easy to install, and it works right after being installed. I&#39;m able to &quot;export&quot; my integrated USB Bluetooth dongle to the VPC, and it works like a charm ! I&#39;m able to run both bluetooth stacks in controlled environments, without crippling my main OS with multiple stacks.</font> 
</p>
<p>
<font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2">A really nice software, not free, but really useful if you&#39;re depending on USB hardware and you want to test it in a virtual environment.</font>
