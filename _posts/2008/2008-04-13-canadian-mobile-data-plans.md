<font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2">I&#39;ve been interrogating myself a lot lately about the current state of mobile internet in Canada. I&#39;m using my cell phone with a 25$&nbsp;a month (excluding taxes) data plan for 5 Megabytes, which makes it almost useless for web browsing. Besides, using an HSDPA cell phone, I would deplete my data plan in about 5 minutes. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2">There&#39;s been a </font><a href="http://www.thomaspurves.com/2007/04/09/canada-worse-than-3rd-world-countries-when-it-comes-to-mobile-data-access/" target="_blank"><font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2">lot of buzz</font></a><font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2"> around the price of Canada data plans and the absence of the iPhone in Canada for the past year. Projections showed that using an iPhone would cost </font><a href="http://www.electronista.com/articles/07/07/10/rogers.data.hinders.iphone/" target="_blank" title="iPhone in Canada"><font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2">something like 300$</font></a><font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2"> a month with data plans comparable to what AT&amp;T is offering. I&#39;m guessing that noone would be interested in paying that much to have a 500MB <strike>almost</strike> unlimited data plan. It seems that Rogers is not willing to let go of the current data plan rates to offer a service that appropriate to the iPhone. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2">I&#39;m new to the Canadian environment,&nbsp;but for what I can tell when I&nbsp;sometimes hear that Canadians are not really into cell phones --&nbsp;that they can live without it and do not really&nbsp;need it --&nbsp;I have an impression of &#39;d&eacute;j&agrave; vu&#39;. French&nbsp;people&nbsp;had this kind of state of mind when there were only two carriers. People at that time also&nbsp;though they did not need cell phones. Except that it was not that they were&nbsp;technophics, it only was because it was darn too expensive !! </font>
</p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2">Now, prices in france have dropped a lot, and people are using a lot of <strong>services</strong> offered by the cell phone carriers. I&#39;m insisting on the services word because I&#39;m sensing that this is where canadians carriers are shooting themselves in the foot by only focusing on being &quot;data pipes&quot;. They could expand their business by offering services that would be far more lucrative than only conveying data or voice. If I consider my own use of the voice plan, knowing that&nbsp;the person I&nbsp;am calling is paying the call when he did&nbsp;not initiate the call, makes me&nbsp;talk less. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2">Ok, there were some improvements&nbsp;the past few months, which&nbsp;</font><a href="http://www.oshawapilot.ca/wp-trackback.php?p=696" target="_blank"><font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2">Mark&nbsp;is pointing out</font></a><font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2">, but which seem&nbsp;to have halted. Bell released a 7$/month plan which made Canada coming from the most expensive country for data plans to the less expensive in the world, which is a bit odd. With a twist though, it&#39;s HTC Touch only. The rest of &quot;improvements&quot; are crippled data plans that are only interesting if you&#39;re willing to use the internet that existed 10 years ago... </font>
</p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2">I&#39;m guessing that breaking the monopoly will change the current state, and that the </font><a href="http://www2.canoe.com/techno/nouvelles/archives/2008/03/20080315-133704.html" target="_blank"><font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2">bidding for new frequencies</font></a><font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2">&nbsp;will force existing carriers to lower their prices to keep their customer base. This is one bit of a stretch, but I&#39;m comparing the state of the industry to the bad phase the music and movie industry is going through right now... There are now forced to understand that they can&#39;t sell their music as a product but as a service if they want to keep their business going. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2">The cell phone industry can be forced to do so to keep their customers, if some newcomer is not playing by the established rules by giving for instance, a flat rate of 45$/month, everything included. I&#39;m not giving this example randomly; I&#39;m referring to the French ISP </font><a href="http://www.free.fr" target="_blank"><font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2">Free.fr</font></a><font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2">&nbsp;which made quite a perturbation when they offered for something like 45$ a month 100 TV channels, <strong>free</strong> phone calls to 100 countries in the world, 25Mbps internet, Wifi access point, and a lot more. All this with an excellent quality of service. They did not play by the&nbsp;established rules, and they are now the second most important player in the market&nbsp;and growing every day. I do not see any reason this would not happen for cell phone carriers the same way it did in France. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2">But maybe there is a good reason for all this&nbsp;though... Canada&#39;s a big &quot;empty&quot; space, and maybe expanding the cell coverage is not as money efficient as it is in France, or USA. I don&#39;t know all the details, so maybe I&#39;m missing some things. </font>

<font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2">We&#39;ll see in the next few months... </font>
