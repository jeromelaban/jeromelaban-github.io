<font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2">Yesterday, Monday 3rd, was the day of Speaker Idol Montreal.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2">I&#39;d
like to thank every attendee for being here and listening all of these
great presentations ! Ten minutes is a format that&#39;s a bit rough
though, one&#39;s got to learn every word to be said to make a good point
during that kind of presentation length. (And don&#39;t rely on the computer
that&#39;s available there... You might end up not being able to use the
keyboard :) )</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2">Anyway, if you were interested by the subject of my
presentation, you may find a more thorough explanation on this blog
post about <a href="/post/2007/02/WPF-DataContext-and-CurrentItem.aspx" target="_blank">DataBinding in WPF</a>. By the way, you may also be interested in this post about <a href="/post/2007/02/WPF-DataBinding-and-Application-Settings.aspx" target="_blank">DataBinding Application Settings</a>. </font>
